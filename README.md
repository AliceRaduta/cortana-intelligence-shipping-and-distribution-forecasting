## Summary

The Demand Forecasting for Shipping and Distribution Solution uses historical demand time series data to forecast demand in future periods. For instance, a shipping or delivery company wants to predict the quantities of the different products its customers will commit at future times. Similarly a vendor or insurer wants to know the number of products that will be returned due to failure over the course of a year. A company can use these forecasts as input to an allocation tool that optimizes delivery vehicles or routes, or to plan capacity in the longer term.

Characteristic of all of these forecasting cases are: 
    
- There are numerous kinds of items with differing volumes, that roll up under one or more category levels.
- There is a history available for the quantity of the item at each time in the past.
- The volumes of the items differ widely, with possibly a substantial number that have zero volume at times. 
- The history of items shows both trend and seasonality, possibly at multiple time scales. 
- The quantities commited or returned are not strongly price sensitive. In other words, the delivery company cannot strongly influence quantities by short-term changes in prices, although there may be other determinants that affect volume, such as weather. 
      
Under these conditions we can take advantage of the hierarchy formed among the time series of the different items. By enforcing consistency so that the quantities lower in the hierarchy (e.g. individual product quantities) sum to the quantities above (customer product totals) we improve the accuracy of the overall forecast. The same applies if individual items are grouped into categories, even possibly categories that overlap. For example, one might be interested in forecasting demand of all products in total, by location, by product category, by customer, etc. 

This solution computes forecasts at all aggregation levels in the hierarchy for each time period specified. For simplicity, we will refer to both hierarchial and grouped time series as "hierarchical time series."

## Description

#### Estimated Provisioning Time: 15 Minutes

The Cortana Intelligence Suite provides advanced analytics tools through Microsoft Azure — data ingestion, data storage, data processing and advanced analytics components — all of the essential elements for building an demand forecasting solution for shipping and distribution.

This solution combines several Azure services to provide powerful advantages. Azure SQL Server instance is used for storing historical distribution data, Azure Machine Learning (AML) webservice for hosting the R forecasting code, Azure Storage Account for intermediate storage of generated forecasts, and Azure Data Factory orchestrates and schedule the entire workflow.

The '*Deploy*' button will launch a workflow that will deploy an instance of the solution within a Resource Group in the Azure subscription you specify. The solution includes multiple Azure services (described below) along with Azure functions that, among other tasks, simulate the data and populates the database with it, so that immediately after deployment you have a working end-to-end solution.

### What's under the hood

The solution uses five types of resources hosted and managed in Azure: 

* *Azure SQL Server* instance (Azure SQL) for persistent storage, 
* *Azure Machine Learning* (AML) webservice to host the R forecasting code, 
* *Azure Blob Storage* for intermediate storage of generated forecasts,
* *Azure Data Factory* (ADF) that orchestrates regular runs of the AML model,  
* *Power BI* dashboard to display and drill down on the forecasts. 

## Using the forecasting solution: Getting started

See the [Technical Solution Guide](./Technical%20Deployment%20Guide/Technical-Solution-How-to-Guide.md) for a full set of instructions on how to put together and deploy the Shipping and Distribution Demand Forecasting Solution using the Cortana Intelligence Suite. For technical problems or questions about deploying this solution, please post in the issues tab of the repository.

## Business Use Case

We adapted this solution for a supply chain collaborator, Kotahi, a company that plans, sources, and delivers shipping containers for New Zealand exports. Read their [Customer Story](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/kotahi) on who they engaged Microsoft and Microsoft Dynamics 2016 Inner Circle partner UXC Eclipse to create an automated demand forecaster using our solution. The solution helped to increase accuracy and improve customer's ability to choose the right-size container ships, at the right times, and dispatch them to the right ports.

## Pricing
Your Azure subscription used for the deployment will incur consumption charges on the services used in this solution, approximately $6.19(USD)/day. For more information, please visit [Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/).
